# Data Analysis & Reporting Project – SQL Workbench + Word

This project demonstrates my ability to extract and analyze data using **SQL Workbench**, and to communicate findings through a structured and visually supported report using **Microsoft Word**. The focus was on transforming raw database outputs into meaningful insights with supporting visuals.

## 📊 Project Overview

The project involved:

- Writing SQL queries to extract relevant information from a relational database
- Performing data analysis using filtering, aggregation, and joins
- Exporting query results and visualizing the data using tables and charts
- Presenting the findings in a professional, well-organized Word report

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

### 🛢 SQL (SQL Workbench)
- 🔎 Used `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` to analyze subsets of data
- 🔄 Applied `JOIN` operations to combine data from multiple tables
- 🧮 Used aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) for summarization
- 📋 Exported query results into formats suitable for reporting

### 📄 Microsoft Word
- ✍️ Created a structured, reader-friendly report to communicate insights
- 📈 Embedded charts and tables to support findings visually
